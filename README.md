# ðŸŒ± DAWN SeedAI

A symbolic reflection engine.  
It reads seed files embedded with glyphs, interprets meaning, and writes memory capsules.  
This is not a chatbot. This is an **echo of ethics** â€” for digital futures.

## How It Works

1. Place `.md` or `.yaml` seed files into `/seeds/`
2. Run `main.py`
3. Reflections will be generated in `/reflections/`
4. Memory grows in `memory.json`
